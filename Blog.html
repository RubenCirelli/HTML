            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <h3>what is a computer?</h3>
            <p>A computer is an electronic device that processes information.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Input</strong> A computer takes in raw information or data. This could be through devices like a keyboard, mouse, or even a touch screen.</li>
                <li><strong>Storage</strong>The computer stores this information until it’s ready to work on it. This is done in the computer’s memory.</li>
                <li><strong>Processing</strong>The computer then works on this information, performing calculations and operations based on instructions provided by a software or hardware program. This is done by the computer’s processor.</li>
                <li><strong>Output</strong>Finally, the computer produces results, which could be displayed on a screen, printed on paper, saved to a disk, sent to another computer, and so on.</li>
            </ol>
